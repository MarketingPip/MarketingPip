I love to make things (try to atleast!), and consider myself a fairly curious person. 
My goal is to help make tools for developers to make their lifes easier, create new projects that benefit society / and to help solve problems that more than just the developer community benefit from!



You can find some of my other work @ [Marketing Pipeline](https://github.com/MarketingPipeline/)
